## Synopsis

This project was created with the goal of cataloging and compiling a number of examples of common SQL queries for use as an easily-referenced library. While an attempt will be made to make all queries generic and usable accross multiple query language implemenations, the majority of these code fragments are written with MS SQL Server in mind.
